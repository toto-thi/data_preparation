In the remaining four units (Cordillera Central, Los Haitises, Punta Cana, and Tiburon Peninsula), the species is Present but not Viable. In both Punta Cana and Cordillera Central, Ridgway's Hawk had been lost until translocation efforts in the 2010s successfully reintroduced individuals. In Los Haitises, surveys in the 2000s revealed that extremely low reproductive success made the subpopulation unsustainable without intensive management. Conservation interventions—including treating nests and nestlings for <em>Philornis</em> larval parasites and engaging local communities to reduce persecution—have steadily increased the species' numbers in this area. Without these and other conservation efforts, the hawk would likely have been extirpated from seven of the eight spatial units by now, reflecting a High Conservation Legacy. If conservation efforts were to cease, the species would likely be rapidly extirpated in Punta Cana and Cordillera Central, as the translocated populations are not yet self-sustaining. However, past conservation actions would likely allow short-term persistence in Los Haitises and Tiburon Peninsula, indicating a Low Conservation Dependence. With continued management, the population in Los Haitises could grow to a Viable level, and populations in other spatial units could at least be maintained (a Low Conservation Gain). In the long term, sustained management, education, and reintroduction efforts could restore the species to at least a Present status in seven of the eight spatial units, with most of these populations reaching Viable or Functional levels—demonstrating a High Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The species is highly sensitive to disturbance, and the majority of the remaining population is confined to protected areas and a 'classified' area (which permits limited resource extraction but prohibits habitat clearance). Without these protections, the species would likely persist in only one of its spatial units—its current stronghold—and in a severely depleted state (a Low but significant Conservation Legacy). Deforestation rates are accelerating across Madagascar, and despite existing protections, the species continues to face illegal habitat destruction. If these protections were removed, habitat loss would intensify rapidly, likely leading to the loss of its stronghold and complete extinction (a High Conservation Dependence). However, conservation measures are expected to continue, with plans to upgrade the classified area to a fully protected area. Additionally, a local conservation organisation is actively implementing various interventions in one of the spatial units, including community education and engagement, alternative livelihoods (such as training locals as beekeepers and forest rangers), ranger patrols for enforcement, and habitat connectivity restoration through corridor planting. With increasing numbers of locals transitioning from slash-and-burn agriculture to beekeeping, population declines in this unit appear to be slowing and could stabilise within the next decade, making the unit Viable. However, there are currently no plans for reintroductions to areas where the species has been extirpated (resulting in a Low Conservation Gain). In the long term, conservationists should aim to restore habitat connectivity through reforestation, expand alternative livelihood programmes, and improve habitat management. With these efforts, along with reintroductions to extirpated areas, the species could become Present or Viable in all spatial units, leading to a Medium Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Finally, the Acigöl Killifish has an Indeterminate Recovery Potential; while the removal of the invasive Eastern Mosquitofish and the establishment of the safety net population are likely within the next 100 years, recovery is limited by climate change and associated habitat loss if lakes dry.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

Most of these plateaus fall within conservation zones, national parks, or wildlife sanctuaries. Without this protection, pressures from excessive tourism, mining, wind farm construction, and other human activities would have likely led to the species' extirpation from multiple plateaus and near-extirpation from others (High Conservation Legacy). Similarly, if conservation efforts were to cease now, these threats would intensify, causing many subpopulations to be lost or pushed to the brink of extirpation within a decade (High Conservation Dependence). While action plans exist for some plateaus and are expected to benefit the species, the extent of their impact over the next 10 years remains uncertain (Indeterminate Conservation Gain). If planned conservation measures are effectively implemented, if currently unprotected sites receive protection, and if anthropogenic pressures are reduced where they pose a significant threat, it may be possible for all plateaus to support Functional subpopulations of the species within 100 years. However, the long-term uncertainty of such projections, coupled with potential climate change impacts, makes the species' future recovery difficult to predict (Indeterminate Recovery Potential).<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Its absence is due to the arrival of non-native mammalian predators, resulting in local extinctions. The Keel-scaled Boa has a High Conservation Legacy since without past conservation actions involving invasive species eradication, habitat restoration and successful translocations, the species would have been lost from all the spatial units, and the species would have gone extinct. There is a High Conservation Dependence, because without strict biosecurity interventions and island monitoring preventing invasive species establishment, it is unlikely the islands would remain predator-free, and past experience shows how rapidly native reptiles are lost from islands in Mauritius following predator invasion. The Conservation Gain is Zero as planned conservation actions over the next 10 years are not expected to change the species' status on islands where the species has already been lost (due to habitat degradation and invasive species), but the effect of future conservation is expected to maintain the currently Functional populations. The Recovery Potential is Low, as the re-establishment of a population of Keel-scaled Boas is only expected in one additional spatial unit, given the widespread nature of several invasive species across mainland Mauritius.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

      "justification": "The North American Beaver has a Species Recovery Score of 83% (Slightly Depleted), because it is fully Functional in three of the six spatial units within its indigenous range, and Viable (but not Functional) in the remaining three. Trapping regulations have played a crucial role in the species' recovery, allowing it to rebound in many areas after historical declines driven by the fur trade. Moreover, conservation translocations have helped bolster depleted subpopulations and reintroduce beavers to areas where they had been extirpated. Without these interventions, it is estimated that the Recovery Score would be as low as 44%, reflecting a High Conservation Legacy. If trapping regulations were removed today, beavers would likely decline in some parts of their range; however, past conservation efforts have brought the species to a level where these declines would not affect its short-term recovery status in the majority of spatial units. As a result, the species is assessed as having Low Conservation Dependence. With ongoing trapping regulations, along with habitat protection and restoration, the species is expected to maintain its current status in the short term (Zero Conservation Gain). Over the next century, additional efforts such as habitat restoration, targeted recovery assessments for at-risk subpopulations, and relocation programmes could help the species recover further toward its historical baseline. However, since its current Recovery Score is already relatively high, its Recovery Potential is assessed as Low.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The species has a High Conservation Legacy because of successful conservation actions that halted population declines; without these actions, extinction was a possibility for all spatial units, but especially the Eastern spatial unit. The Black Rhino's Conservation Dependence reflects that, while population declines would be expected within the next 10 years if conservation actions stopped, it is unlikely that any spatial units would become extinct within that time. However, it should be noted that while this Conservation Dependence of 10% is classified as Low, it is very close to the threshold for Medium Conservation Dependence (&gt;10%). The Black Rhino has a Medium Conservation Gain, reflecting that if population recovery continues on course for the next 10 years, the species will be at least Viable in three of four spatial units. The Recovery Potential for the species is High, as it would be possible to restore Functional populations over much of the Eastern, South-central, and Southwestern spatial units, and to restore some Black Rhinos to the Western spatial unit.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

This reflects its varying state across the 20 spatial units within its indigenous range: it is Absent in four, Present in nine, Viable in two, and Functional in five. The species was hunted to near extinction during the maritime fur trade (1741–1911) but made a significant recovery following international protection in 1911 and subsequent reintroductions. Without these interventions, the species would likely be extinct today, highlighting a High Conservation Legacy. Despite rebounding from historical lows, the Sea Otter remains threatened in many areas, with ongoing declines in some parts of its range. If protections were removed, the species would likely be extirpated from most spatial units due to hunting, persecution, and harassment, demonstrating a High Conservation Dependence. With current conservation measures in place, the species is expected to maintain its current status in most spatial units, with potential recolonisation of some Absent units over the next decade through natural immigration. Consequently, Conservation Gain is assessed as Low but significant. Further recovery to Functional levels across all spatial units within 100 years is feasible with targeted conservation actions such as translocations, harassment prevention, and protection from harvest. In regions where predation by Orcas poses a significant threat, continued protections for Grey Whales – the primary prey of Orcas – are expected to help reduce predation pressure on Sea Otters in the long term. The potential for full restoration qualifies the species for a High Recovery Potential rating.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The species enjoys legal protection and protection within a biosphere reserve; however, the level of habitat degradation within the biosphere is not much lower than outside it, and the impact of legal protection is difficult to determine. Thus, the Conservation Legacy is Zero, but there is some uncertainty in this, and it is nonetheless expected that without past conservation, this species would persist, but in much lower numbers than seen today. However, Conservation Dependence is High; because of the recent increase in high-intensity grazing and agriculture occurring in the area, the land protected by the biosphere is increasingly in demand for deep drilling for groundwater and intense agriculture, which (together with other threats) would likely drive the species to extinction within 10 years if protection was removed. Bolson Tortoises have been reintroduced into a large area of private land in New Mexico, but these will not reproduce in the next 10 years and so cannot be considered when assessing the short-term Conservation Gain (which is predicted to be Zero). However, within the next 100 years, this population will likely be considered wild and will hopefully have reached a Viable size. There are plans to reintroduce the species to two additional sites, and it is hoped that these populations will also be Viable within 100 years. While there is uncertainty around the effect of climate change on the success of these reintroductions, the Recovery Potential is categorised as High.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

In the main spring of the El Texcal spatial unit, past threats included two invasive fish species, the Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and the Variable Platyfish (<em>Xiphophorus variatus</em>), as well as the invasive plant <em>Egeria densa</em>. Since 2000, local communities have actively controlled <em>Egeria</em>, and both the trout and platys have been eradicated. Without these efforts, the species would not have remained Viable in this unit. In the Cuernavaca spatial unit, legal protections for streams have prevented urban expansion that would have otherwise polluted the waterways and led to local extirpation. In contrast, the other two spatial units have seen minimal conservation impact to date. As a result, Conservation Legacy is assessed as Medium. If conservation measures were abandoned, threats such as pollution, invasive species, and unsustainable management would likely degrade all streams, but the extent to which this would impact the species remains uncertain. Therefore, Conservation Dependence is classified as Indeterminate. Future conservation efforts over the next decade show promise, with community-based action plans, land management initiatives, and invasive species eradication programmes in the pipeline. These measures are expected to restore the species to Functional levels in most spatial units, supporting an assessment of Medium Conservation Gain. Over the long term, sustainable spring management and continued invasive species removal could maintain three of the four spatial units at a Functional level, leading to a Medium Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

It is Possibly Extinct in the Wild in one spatial unit (assessed as most likely Absent), as a result of threats including predation by non-native fish and high poaching pressure, and Critically Endangered in the other spatial unit. This species has a Conservation Legacy of Zero because even with legal protection of the species and its occurrence within a protected area in Timor-Leste, it is still believed to be declining. The Conservation Gain is Zero&#160; despite the establishment of a reintroduction programme on Roti Island. This is due to the time-lag in introduced individuals being considered wild, meaning the status is not expected to change in either of the spatial units within 10 years. Future re-assessments of this species will better reflect the impact of this species reintroduction work. The Conservation Dependence is also Zero because there are currently no targeted conservation or threat mitigation actions in the remaining population on Timor-Leste, and none are planned to be implemented in the short-term future. It is likely that even with the current national park and legal protection, the species will still be lost. The Recovery Potential for this species is High because there is a breeding and reintroduction programme and with control of predatory fish and habitat restoration, this species could be restored in multiple lakes within its indigenous range.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

In regions where the species is Functional, natural geomorphological and epizoochorous processes sustain active metapopulation dynamics, and the species is not at risk of extirpation. In the North European Palearctic region, conservation efforts have driven recovery in many areas, including the rediscovery of the species in Bulgaria at restored sites. Without these actions, the species would likely not be Functional in this region. However, in other areas, conservation efforts have not significantly influenced its status, resulting in a Low Conservation Legacy. If current conservation measures continue, the species is expected to maintain its current status across all spatial units (Zero Conservation Gain). However, if conservation efforts were to cease, the species would likely lose its Functional status in the North European Palearctic region within the next decade (Low Conservation Dependence). In the long term, identifying and targeting non-Functional subpopulations with conservation actions, such as landscape restoration and reintroductions, could improve the Species Recovery Score to 95%, a 6% increase from the current score (Low Recovery Potential).

Despite its depleted state, the species has a High Conservation Legacy; measures such as area protection, reintroductions, poaching prevention, road kill mitigation, and genetic management have reversed population declines and prevented likely extinction. Continuation of these measures, as well as planned reintroductions to spatial units in which the species is currently Absent, are expected to double the Recovery Score in 10 years: a Medium Conservation Gain. If all conservation were to stop, declines would resume and the species would probably be extirpated from the East Spain spatial unit within 10 years, reducing the Recovery Score to 16%. However, populations would persist in at least three spatial units in this timeframe, so the Conservation Dependence is Low. Enough suitable habitat remains that the species could reach Fully Recovered status in 100 years, assuming conservation efforts continue with maximum efficacy. There is some uncertainty in this prediction, as the possibility of multiple disease outbreaks in European Rabbits (the species' main prey item) could hamper progress, but the Recovery Potential remains High.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

      "justification": "The Large-antlered Muntjac has a Species Recovery Score of 15% (Critically Depleted) because remnant populations are small and low-density, and the species is undergoing declines in all three spatial units from which it is known. Area protection has mitigated loss and degradation of habitat, preventing likely extirpation of the species from one of the spatial units. The impact of protection has been less decisive in the other two units, as they contain forests that are large and remote enough that they probably would not have been totally cleared if they were not protected. Thus, the species has a Low Conservation Legacy. However, it has a High Conservation Dependence, because cessation of area protection and enforcement against poaching would likely reduce the Recovery Score to 5% within 10 years. Given that short-term conservation of this species is focussed on mitigating threats and preventing declines – which is an essential starting point to facilitating long-term recovery – the Conservation Gain over the next 10 years is predicted to be Zero. In 100 years, however, this species' recovery status has the potential to improve dramatically. This will require consolidation of current protective measures, complemented by well-planned <em>ex situ</em> breeding and translocation programs to boost populations. If such measures are funded and executed with maximum efficacy, the Recovery Score could increase more than five-fold to 80%, a High Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

However, given the demand for land, and the fact that gibbon species are hunted for food and traditional medicine, without continued protection, it is expected the Hainan Gibbon would be lost in 10 years, resulting in a High Conservation Dependence. As the remaining forest habitat is highly fragmented and the current population is very small, recovery of this species will be slow.

      "justification": "The Species Recovery Score of 13% (Critically Depleted) is due to the Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat being Absent in one of its three spatial units, and Present as Critically Endangered and Endangered in the remaining two. Despite its Critically Depleted status, the species has a High Conservation Legacy because it is predicted that without conservation actions that halted habitat loss (i.e. site protection, site management, conservation payments, compliance and enforcement, and local policies and regulations) the species would have been lost. The most significant limiting factors for this species are habitat loss and degradation; consequently, the most impactful conservation actions are those related to habitat protection and restoration. However, within a 10-year time frame, the slow growth of the forest will limit population increase, as the habitat is not expected to support a Viable population. Without habitat protection measures it is expected that in the short-term future, steep population declines would likely result in either population extirpation or survival in low densities, which results in a High Conservation Dependence for the species. Over the next 10 years if conservation continues, the Conservation Gain is expected to be Zero; with no planned reintroductions, the populations in Ambadira and Kirindy are unlikely to change significantly over that time period. Finally, within the next 100 years, it is expected that increased human-induced pressures will negatively affect Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat subpopulations. Combined with the slow growth rate of the forest habitat the Giant Jumping Rat depends on, these pressures will hamper recovery and prevent the establishment of Viable populations. Consequently, the Recovery Potential is Low: it is unlikely that populations will recover beyond the Endangered category under criterion B1ab(iii), given the persistence of unavoidable drivers such as increased human population and climate change, which continue to lead to habitat degradation.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

Despite its depleted state the subspecies has a High Conservation Legacy; measures such as protected areas, legislation banning killing of the Arabian Leopard, and livestock compensation programmes have slowed population declines and prevented potential extinction. Continuation of these measures, as well as successful <em>ex situ</em> breeding programmes and reintroductions, are expected to double the Recovery Score in 10 years: a Medium Conservation Gain. If all conservation were to stop, declines would continue and intensify, and in the worst-case scenario the Arabian Leopard could be Extinct in 10 years' time. However, due to the short timeframe it is most likely that in the next 10 years the subspecies would remain in the two spatial units where it is currently Present, albeit at reduced levels: Conservation Dependence is assessed as Zero. In the next 100 years we see High Recovery Potential; although the future is uncertain, if all plausible conservation measures are applied (e.g. strengthening the <em>ex situ</em> breeding programme, protected areas, and successful reintroductions) in 100 years the Arabian Leopard could be Present in all spatial units, most likely Functional in two spatial units, and in a best-case scenario could be Functional across the indigenous range (Fully Recovered). Conservation efforts have been, and will continue to be, crucial in preventing extinction of the Arabian Leopard. Although the subspecies still faces an uncertain future, with continued and intensified long-term conservation efforts there is great potential for the recovery of this Critically Endangered and Critically Depleted subspecies.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Without conservation action to date—namely, protected areas and anti-poaching enforcement—it is likely that the subspecies would have disappeared from an additional spatial unit, though it would probably still be Present in the other three (a Low Conservation Legacy). Continuation of these measures, and the implementation of new measures including several national and regional conservation action plans, is expected to benefit the subspecies. However, the scope and severity of threats will probably not be abated sufficiently for the state of any spatial unit to improve short-term (Zero Conservation Gain). If all conservation were to stop, threats such as habitat loss, hunting, and illegal trade would accelerate, causing the leopard to vanish from many sites that it is currently found in. The categories used in this assessment (Absent, Present, Viable, Functional) are not sensitive enough to capture these losses at the spatial unit level, so the Conservation Dependence is Zero, but it is important to emphasise the necessity of continuing and improving conservation efforts. In 100 years, it would be possible to reintroduce the species to Northern Africa, where it is currently Absent. However, even with maximum conservation effort, restoring Viable spatial unit populations will be challenging due to projected climate-induced habitat loss and human population growth. Therefore, while the subspecies does have Recovery Potential, it is Low.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Before conservation efforts began, the species had persisted despite years of predation by two invasive predators: the snail <em>Euglandina rosea</em> and the flatworm <em>Platydemus manokwari</em>. This suggests that even in the absence of conservation, the species would likely still exist today. However, translocations have successfully re-established one previously extirpated subpopulation, demonstrating a Low but significant Conservation Legacy. While these translocations have been effective and are set to continue, they are not occurring at a scale that would significantly improve the species' status within the next decade, resulting in a Zero Conservation Gain. The reintroduced subpopulations have now reached a stable stage where reinforcement is no longer necessary, meaning that even if conservation efforts ceased, they would likely persist at their current status – the species is therefore assessed as having Zero Conservation Dependence. In the long term, it is believed that this species could be restored to Functional population densities. Since mitigating the threat of predation by <em>Platydemus manokwari</em> is impossible, the species' survival depends on establishing stable subpopulations capable of withstanding some level of predation. Through continued research, captive breeding, and release, the initial focus will be on increasing individual numbers at release sites. This could eventually expand the species' range through additional releases, creating more resilient subpopulations. The species is already close to having re-established sufficiently that wild subpopulations could serve as sources for future translocations, significantly enhancing the potential for range expansion. Therefore, its Recovery Potential is High.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Without the designation of protected areas in Mangabe and Anjozorobe, these strongholds would have experienced significant deforestation, leaving the remnant population in an even more precarious state. However, the species can tolerate some disturbance and persists in two unprotected forest fragments (Ambatovy mining area and Andramasina). This suggests that even in the absence of conservation efforts, it would likely survive in at least one spatial unit, though in a highly depleted state (Zero Conservation Legacy). Deforestation rates are accelerating across Madagascar, and despite existing protections, the species continues to face illegal habitat destruction. However, due to its resilience, it would likely persist—albeit in a more degraded state—even if conservation efforts ceased (Zero Conservation Dependence). A local conservation organisation is actively implementing a range of interventions in areas where the species remains, including community education and engagement, training in more sustainable and higher-yielding farming methods, recruitment of rangers from local communities, and connectivity restoration through corridor planting. With increasing adoption of sustainable farming techniques, population declines in this unit appear to be slowing and could stabilise within the next decade, making it Viable. However, there are currently no plans for reintroductions to areas where the species has been extirpated, resulting in a Low Conservation Gain. In the long term, conservationists should focus on restoring habitat connectivity through reforestation, expanding education programs, and improving habitat management. With these actions, combined with reintroductions to extirpated areas, the species could become Viable in all spatial units over the next century (a High Recovery Potential).<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

There is a High Conservation Dependence because without conservation interventions to protect the species' habitat, it is expected to disappear due to habitat degradation and deforestation. The Conservation Gain is Zero for the species, given that within a 10-year period, there are no conservation plans for the species in the Eastern spatial unit, and in the Western spatial unit education programmes, forest management and training of rangers are expected to maintain population stability.

Conservation Legacy is High for this species; without protected areas, much of the species' forest habitat would have been cleared, fragmented, or degraded by now (as has been the case in non-protected areas) and the Recovery Score would be less than half of what it is today. The species' Conservation Dependence is Low; while ongoing protection is critical to the persistence of remnant populations, the consequences of revoking protection would not be fully realised in the 10-year timeframe over which Dependence is measured. Similarly, the expected positive outcome of planned conservation measures – namely, the designation of new protected areas – will not come to fruition within 10 years, so Conservation Gain is Zero. Long-term, however, it would be feasible to establish Functional populations in South Unguja. This would require forest restoration with a focus on improving connectivity.

      "justification": "The Polynesian Tree Snail has a Species Recovery Score of 83% (Slightly Depleted) because it is fully Functional on five of the seven islands within its indigenous range. On the remaining two islands, it is locally Endangered on Tubuai and Near Threatened on Tahiti due to historical population crashes caused by the introduced predator <em>Euglandina rosea</em>. However, the species is now believed to be increasing on Tahiti, having persisted despite <em>E. rosea</em> invasion due to its tolerance of dry, sunny habitats, such as forest edges, which provide a solar refuge where <em>E. rosea</em> cannot hunt for extended periods. A similar recovery is expected on Tubuai. Because this species is less vulnerable to invasive predators than other <em>Partula</em> species and because invasive predators are absent from most of its indigenous range, it has not been a priority for conservation action, and little intervention has been undertaken to date. As a result, its Conservation Legacy is assessed as Zero. Similarly, since no future conservation actions are planned, its Conservation Gain is also assessed as Zero. However, there is a risk that, without conservation measures, the invasive flatworm <em>Platydemus manokwari</em> could spread to islands where this species occurs. The potential impact remains uncertain, as <em>P. manokwari</em> has only been recorded on islands where <em>Partula hyalina</em> was already depleted, but it could lead to a population crash. Therefore, Conservation Dependence is assessed as Indeterminate. In the long term, given the species' apparent resilience to invasive predators, it is hoped that the populations on Tahiti and Tubuai will recover to Functional levels, even in the absence of major conservation efforts. Consequently, its Recovery Potential is assessed as Medium.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Because of its EW status, its Conservation Legacy and Dependence are assessed as Zero. Attempts to reintroduce the species to its indigenous range on Raiatea Island have failed, and are unlikely to ever succeed, because of the presence of invasive predatory flatworm <em>Platydemus manokwari</em>. However, it may be possible to release the species into predator exclosures, and suitable sites for such exclosures have been identified on Moorea and Tahiti. An exclosure is being built on Moorea as of late 2023, and should be ready for trial releases in 2024–2025. If this succeeds, a population could be released and established within the next 10 years, reversing the species' EW status – a High Conservation Gain. While it is not possible to mitigate the threat of predation by <em>P. manokwari</em>, it is plausible that, within 100 years, Functional subpopulations of the species could be established in predator exclosures on Moorea and Tahiti.

      "justification": "The Species Recovery Score of 30% (Largely Depleted) is due to the Lion being most likely Absent in two of its ten spatial units, most likely Viable in one spatial unit, and most likely Present in the remaining seven. Despite its depleted state the species has a High Conservation Legacy; in the absence of conservation actions, notably protected areas and legal protections, the Lion would have faced even greater declines across its range. This would most likely have resulted in the one spatial unit which is currently Viable being classed as Present due to declines, and extirpation of the species from four spatial units where it is currently Present. Conservation Gain is Zero; even with continued and planned conservation actions, the next ten years is too short a timeframe to expect significant recovery given the biological limitations of the species, although the current recovery status is expected to be maintained. However, Conservation Dependence is Medium; if all conservation actions were to stop, population declines would continue and intensify across the range, and in the next ten years the Lion would be extirpated from three spatial units where it is currently Present. In the next 100 years the Lion faces an uncertain future. If all plausible conservation measures could be applied with maximum efficacy (e.g. establishment of new protected areas, maintenance of existing protected areas, and reintroductions) then in a best-case scenario – considering an optimistic scenario for climate change and human demographic shifts – Lions could be Present across all spatial units and even Viable in eight out of ten spatial units in 100 years. However, even in this most optimistic scenario it is not likely for the Lion to reach the Functional state in any spatial unit due to irreversible anthropogenic impacts (e.g. habitat conversion) limiting recovery of the Lion across its indigenous range. Other factors beyond the control of conservation (e.g. climate change, terrorism and political instability, and human demographic shifts) could also limit Lion recovery. In a worst-case scenario, even with all plausible conservation actions in place, we could see extirpation from one spatial unit which is currently assessed as Present, as well as continued and intensified threats across the other spatial units within the next 100 years. This uncertainty is captured by the Low Recovery Potential, which highlights the need for continued and intensified conservation efforts to enable both Lion survival and recovery in the face of the great challenges presented by ongoing and potential emergent threats in the next 100 years.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Some subpopulations are protected under the Habitat Directive of the Bern Convention, and there are species action plans in place in France and Spain. Furthermore, several of the basins in which the species is found are protected within Natura 2000 sites. Without these conservation measures, it is estimated that the species would be Absent from eight of its indigenous basins, reflecting a High Conservation Legacy. The subpopulations of the Loire, Garonne, and Ardour basins are currently very small (&lt;500 individuals each). If conservation efforts stopped, these subpopulations would likely disappear within 10 years due to their high fragmentation and small sizes, which increase the likelihood of stochastic events leading to extirpation. Thus, the species' Conservation Dependence is assessed as High. However, if current measures continue, all basins are expected to retain their current status (Zero Conservation Gain). Long-term, conservationists should focus on protecting host fish species, removing threats, and expanding protected areas. There are currently no aspirations to reintroduce the species to basins where it has been extirpated, as efforts would be best directed toward improving existing subpopulations. An exception is the Seine, where reintroductions would be feasible and desirable, as extirpation is believed to have been relatively recent in this basin. Given the potential to enhance existing subpopulations and potentially reintroduce the species to the Seine, Recovery Potential is assessed as Medium.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The primary conservation actions for this species have included regulation of the fisheries of their prey, but the species' score is not expected to be different today in the absence of this action (Conservation Legacy of Zero), though there is uncertainty around this estimate. Over the next 10 years, the best estimate is that the species would decline if conservation action stopped, but the future impact of conservation actions is hard to estimate precisely given that climate change is predicted to cause declines in species status over the same period; therefore, a dynamic baseline was used, but even so Conservation Dependence and Gain are both Indeterminate. Finally, in 100 years, due to climate change the most optimistic estimate is that the species will have declined to a Recovery Score of 60%, meaning that the Recovery Potential is Negative.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Encino Arroyero has a Conservation Legacy of Zero due to the species' extremely long generation time and continued threats, even within protected areas. Because of the possible states that can be assigned in the Green Status assessment, there is also Zero Conservation Dependence; if conservation actions were to stop, it is expected that the species would indeed decline majorly over a 10-year period, but likely some individuals would remain, which would mean the species was still Present in all of its spatial units. Encino Arroyero has a Medium Conservation Gain; within a 10-year period, if proposed bans on cutting down these trees are implemented, and planned seedling planting is carried out, it is expected that the species could become Viable in some of its spatial units, leading to a score of 44%. Finally, within 100 years it would be possible for Encino Arroyero to become Functional in two spatial units and Viable in most, leading to a score of 77%.

Furthermore, extant subpopulations are suffering from high mortality caused by infection with chytrid fungus. Despite its depleted state, the species has a Medium Conservation Legacy; without conservation measures like <em>ex situ</em> breeding, reintroduction, and predator barriers, the species is expected to have disappeared in two more spatial units. Despite ongoing conservation actions (including research, actions to combat chytrid fungus, habitat restoration, reintroduction efforts, and predator management), it is unlikely that these measures will change the status of the any Southern Mountain Yellow-legged Frog spatial units to Viable within the next 10 years, so the Southern Yellow-legged Frog's Conservation Gain is Zero. Nonetheless, given that the species persists in few localities, without <em>ex situ</em> breeding and reintroduction efforts its is likely that extant subpopulations would be more vulnerable to population crashes caused by chytrid infections and stochastic events (like droughts and fires); therefore the Conservation Dependence is Medium. In the long term, captive breeding and reintroduction efforts are expected to increase population numbers, and chytrid management and research are anticipated to positively impact species survival; with population and genetic management, it would be possible for many spatial units to reach a Viable state within 100 years. However, the species is unlikely to reach a Functional state in any spatial units due to the combined threats and stressors of introduced fish, disease-induced mortality, habitat degradation and climate change; therefore, the species' Recovery Potential is Medium.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

Storm-induced flooding, which was probably the cause of the species' extirpation from two of the extinct estuaries, poses an ongoing threat that could drive either of the remaining populations to Critically Endangered or Extinct status in a short period of time. While the species and its habitat are legally protected, these laws are weakly enforced and unlikely to have had a notable impact on the state of the population (Zero Conservation Legacy). As such, the species persistence is unlikely to depend on whether or not these laws are in place (Zero Conservation Dependence). However, a recovery action strategy has been developed for the species that involves research, education, habitat protection, <em>ex situ</em> breeding, and reintroduction to the extirpated estuaries. No reintroductions are due to take place in the next decade, and flooding will remain a pervasive threat, so the expected short-term Conservation Gain is Zero; but in the next century, re-establishment of the extinct populations (with <em>ex situ</em> 'back up' populations maintained in case of flooding) could improve the Species Recovery Score to 33%.

      "justification": "Raffles' Banded Langur has a Species Recovery Score of 15% (Critically Depleted) as it persists in very small, often severely fragmented subpopulations across all three of the spatial units within its indigenous range. The establishment of the Raffles' Banded Langur Working Group and a Species Action Plan has driven ongoing conservation efforts for the species. These efforts have included roadkill mitigation measures like rope bridges, awareness-raising initiatives, improved research efforts, and long-standing habitat protection. Without these actions, the species would likely have been extirpated from one of the spatial units by now (a Low Conservation Legacy).<br/><br/>The '<em>Presbytis</em> Conservation Action Plan 2024–2034' outlines plans to restore habitat connectivity through tree planting and rope bridge construction (Ang <em>et al.</em> 2024), which will complement the Pahang 30x30 initiative. In combination with continued area protection and the implementation of the Species Action Plan, these measures are expected to increase the size and connectivity of subpopulations over the next decade. However, the species will still face a very high risk of extinction (the predicted Conservation Gain is Low).<br/><br/>If conservation efforts were to cease, habitat destruction and fragmentation would accelerate due to expanding plantations and urban sprawl, likely leading to the rapid extirpation of the remaining subpopulations, as has occurred in unprotected former range areas (High Conservation Dependence).<br/><br/>Long-term, conservationists should aim to improve the species' genetic viability through translocations. Combined with habitat protection and restoration efforts, this offers the potential for the species to become Viable or Functional across all its spatial units (High Recovery Potential).<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The species has a High Conservation Legacy, as without the protection of St Helena Island National Park, its last fragment of habitat would have been lost, leading to extinction.

While some areas benefit from area protection and habitat management, the impact of these measures on the species is likely to be limited. Current management activities are insufficient to address the threat posed by fire-promoting invasive grasses, with removal efforts unable to keep pace with their spread. Moreover, the species persists outside protected and managed areas, indicating it would still be Present without conservation interventions. The Conservation Legacy is therefore assessed as Zero.<br/><br/>There are no planned conservation actions likely to benefit the wild population of <em>C. calcicola</em> within the next 10 years beyond the limited impact of ongoing measures. Anyhow, the species' long generation time means any positive outcomes from conservation would take much longer than a decade to manifest. Consequently, the Conservation Gain and Conservation Dependence within this timeframe are also Zero.<br/><br/>Long-term conservation measures that could be feasible include better-resourced habitat management, reintroduction programmes, and the establishment of genetically representative assurance colonies. These actions could reverse declines and improve connectivity, enabling all spatial units to achieve Viable status, amounting to a Medium Recovery Potential. However, this estimate should be treated with caution, as low genetic diversity and the absence of a seed dispersal agent may limit the likelihood of success.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

However, conservation efforts, including protective fencing and a translocation project, have greatly improved the species' prospects. Translocations have been highly successful, with demographic data indicating that the population is now stable. Without these conservation actions, the population would be smaller and in decline, and habitat degradation would be progressing at a faster rate. Despite these positive impacts, the Conservation Legacy remains Zero, as the species' status has not yet improved beyond Critically Endangered. If conservation were to cease, the population would likely remain stable for the next decade due to past translocation efforts, resulting in a Conservation Dependence score of Zero. Longer-term, however, unmitigated habitat degradation would lead to population decline, highlighting the need for continued habitat protection. With continuation of current conservation efforts, habitat degradation is expected to slow to a halt over the next decade. Combined with additional reintroductions, which could increase the population to over 1,000 mature individuals, the species is projected to improve to Least Concern by 2035—a High Conservation Gain. Demographic data suggest that, over 100 years, the population could expand and recolonise the dune system, provided its stable size distribution is maintained. This reflects a High Recovery Potential. Continued monitoring remains essential to ensure population stability.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

A key threat to the species in the Atlantic Rainforest is harvesting for palm heart. Without its illegalisation in Brazil in 2008 and the protection provided by designated conservation areas, the population would face a significantly higher risk of extirpation. In the Cerrado, palm heart harvesting is not a major threat, and the species is found exclusively in gallery forests, which are legally protected. Without this protection, the destruction of gallery forests would likely track the rapid deforestation of the broader Cerrado biome, making the population non-Viable. As a result, the Conservation Legacy is assessed as Medium. If conservation measures were to cease, a similar situation would unfold over the next decade, justifying a Medium Conservation Dependence. However, current conservation measures are expected to continue, helping both biome populations maintain their current status (Zero Conservation Gain). Looking ahead, the extent of climatically suitable habitat in the Atlantic Rainforest is expected to expand over the next century. Increasing protected area coverage, enforcing regulations against harvesting and deforestation, and implementing reintroduction and fruit management programmes could reverse population declines within this timeframe. Predicting the species' recovery potential in the Cerrado is more challenging due to limited data on its current distribution, status, and threats in this biome. While it is likely that the species could become Functional in much of the Cerrado—since gallery forests can persist despite agricultural expansion—uncertainties remain. Therefore, the species' Recovery Potential is considered Indeterminate.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

In Morocco–Western Sahara, conservation measures such as a national strategy, captive breeding, and reintroduction programmes have been crucial in sustaining the population. Without these efforts, significant declines would be expected. Conversely, Algeria and Tunisia have seen little effective conservation action benefiting the species to date, resulting in a Low Conservation Legacy. If conservation efforts ceased today, the Morocco–Western Sahara population would likely become threatened with extinction within a decade due to its reliance on reintroductions. Meanwhile, the Algerian and Tunisian populations would likely maintain their current threatened status, as they have persisted this long with minimal conservation intervention. Thus, Conservation Dependence is assessed as Low. A conservation workshop held in Tunisia in 2016 resulted in the development of a strategy for recovering the species in the country, leading to some reintroductions. While these efforts have slightly increased the population, they have not yet improved its conservation status. However, the strategy is expected to enhance the Tunisian population's state over the next decade, reducing its extinction risk, though it will likely remain threatened. The Morocco–Western Sahara and Algerian populations are expected to maintain their current status over this timeframe. Therefore, the predicted Conservation Gain is Low. With conservation actions and plans already in place, there is hope for long-term improvement in the species' status. A small number of individuals are held in <em>ex situ</em> care, serving as a potential source for conservation translocations to areas lacking ongoing efforts. However, uncertainty regarding the species' status in Algeria and its potential for improvement means the Recovery Potential remains Indeterminate.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The species persists in several protected areas, which have helped slow its decline; without them, its status in at least one spatial unit would likely be worse (a Low but significant Conservation Legacy). If these protected areas were removed, the species would likely be extirpated from the spatial unit where it is already close to (or possibly already) extinct, and its risk of extinction in the other unit would significantly increase within a decade due to unrestricted hunting (a High Conservation Dependence). However, over the next decade, several planned conservation actions aim to reverse the population decline. The 2020–2029 conservation framework outlines key priorities, including population surveys to assess its current status, anti-poaching measures, and enhancements to the captive population through improved management protocols and the construction of a new breeding facility in Tunisia—representing a Low but significant Conservation Gain. In the long term, feasibility studies for reintroductions could pave the way for the recovery of a Viable wild population within 100 years. Fewer than 100 Slender-horned Gazelles exist in captivity, with approximately 78 in the USA and 17 in Europe, providing a potential source for future reintroductions—resulting in a Medium Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

The loss of Bojer's Skink across much of its former range was due to the arrival of invasive predator species that led to extirpation. Bojer's Skink has a Low Conservation Legacy because it was able to persist in the presence of some non-native predators and even without past conservation actions, it is expected to have remained relatively undisturbed on two of the islands on which it is found, due to their remoteness and difficulty to access. However, due to the threat posed by invasive predators and the importance of past predator control in increasing the numbers on several islands, the Conservation Legacy score (8%) is close to the threshold for being considered a High Conservation Legacy (9%). Similarly, Conservation Dependence is assessed as Low due to the potential for this species to remain relatively undisturbed on two very difficult to access islands, but again the Conservation Dependence score (8%) is close to the threshold for being considered a High Conservation Dependence (9%). Conservation Gain is Zero as future actions in a 10-year time frame are not expected to change the species status on islands where the species has already been lost (due to invasive species) and short-term future conservation is expected to maintain current populations within spatial units. The Recovery Potential within 100 years is Low, as two of the three spatial unit where this species could be restored are already Functional. The aspiration is that in the future, the Southern Island spatial unit will become Functional, and that reintroductions to Flat Island and Gabriel Island, following the removal of shrews, will increase the proportion of the Northern Islands spatial unit that is Functional.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

This species has a Conservation Legacy of Zero as to date, the main conservation action has been the establishment of protected areas. Despite this protection, there are still pressures of poaching and livestock grazing in the Talas Mountains areas and the population was lost from the Tajikistan and Kuraminskyi Ridge spatial unit, despite the establishment of a protected area. In addition, individuals have persisted outside protected areas in the Chatkal and Chimgan spatial unit, demonstrating that in the past they have not been completely reliant on habitat protection. The Conservation Dependence is Low (10%) because, whilst in one spatial unit the population is expected to decline from Endangered to Critically Endangered without continued conservation, the status of the Talas spatial unit is expected to improve from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable, even without continued conservation. This is because the large population decline in the previous three generations has now stabilised, and the population is expected to remain stable or increase due to a number of factors. Livestock grazing has stabilized and shows no immediate signs of expansion, and there are changing attitudes towards participation in hunting by younger herders, and a reduced reliance on dogs by herders, which posed a threat to Menzbier's Marmots. Conservation Gain is also Low (10%) because despite expected improvements in the next decade, this is partially attributed to conservation action, such as planned protected area expansion in Uzbekistan, but also partly due to the aforementioned attitudinal changes. Menzbier's Marmot has a Medium Recovery Potential (23%) because it is unlikely that the lost part of the range will be restored to support Menzbier's Marmot populations, and in other parts of the range, habitat loss induced by climate change is likely unavoidable, thus is expected to constrain the species full recovery. Human population growth and increased infrastructure and livestock to support it is expected in higher elevations, where the species range is likely to shift in response to climate change (as it is already being observed). However, with the expected expansion of protected areas it is likely that &gt;50% of the species range will be protected and that currently fragmented subpopulations could reconnect.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

It is hoped that proposed measures to protect and enhance spoonbill habitat will slow the decline in habitat quality, but it is unlikely that these declines will be reversed within 10 years. Thus, the species will most likely retain its current threatened status, equating to Zero Conservation Gain. However, if all conservation were to stop, the progress made over the last decades would most likely be lost and the species' status would revert to Critically Endangered: it therefore has a High Conservation Dependence. Even though some habitat will be lost to development in the next 100 years, it would be possible (with dedicated planning and funding commitments) to protect enough of the species' range that the population could return to a Fully Recovered state.

Harvest management has likely helped mitigate declines in some subspecies, and <em>Neogale vison evergladensis</em> and <em>N. v. halilimnetes</em> benefit from legal protection in some areas. However, the overall impact of these measures on the species' status is unclear, leading to an Indeterminate Conservation Legacy. For the same reason, it is uncertain what negative effects would result from removing these measures, making Conservation Dependence also Indeterminate. There is an action plan in place for <em>N. v. evergladensi</em>s, which includes goals to expand its area of occupancy, mitigate threats, and enhance habitat quality. While this may improve the subspecies' status over the next 10 years, other subspecies are not expected to see substantial conservation benefits in this timeframe, resulting in a Low expected Conservation Gain. In the long term, efforts such as increasing genetic diversity, controlling invasive domestic mink, improving trapping regulations, restoring habitat, and studying the impacts of introgression could help the species reach a Functional status in nearly all spatial units. However, given the uncertainty surrounding both its current status and its potential response to conservation, the Recovery Potential remains Indeterminate.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Population improvements sufficient to change the state in any of the spatial units from Present to Viable are not expected in the short term, resulting in a Conservation Gain of Zero. However, in the absence of continued conservation, the smaller southern population would be expected to be extirpated within 10 years due to hunting and land clearance, resulting in a Medium Conservation Dependence.

Hunting is a key threat to this species, and anti-snare work has already been observed to have a positive impact in some national parks.

Without area protection and invasive plant control to date, the sole Functional spatial unit would probably not be Functional, representing a Low (but significant) Conservation Legacy.

Given the limited size of protected areas and the general absence of law enforcement, it is believed that the species' state would only be slightly worse without these measures. With few conservation actions planned and in place for the species, there is no improvement expected in the short-term future; thus, the Conservation Gain is Zero. However, if the few actions were stopped, the species would likely decrease to even lower numbers in a 10-year time frame (persisting only in remote areas), so the species has a Low Conservation Dependence. Finally, the Mountain Nyala has a Medium Recovery Potential because its status could be substantially improved in a 100-year time frame. The government and local people have a positive attitude towards improving the species' status, so it is likely that further conservation actions will be implemented. Sustainable trophy hunting has the potential to fund effective conservation in some areas, and the Ethiopian government is actively initiating conservation plans that will hopefully reverse declines.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

In Bhutan, the species benefits from a national mandate to maintain 60% forest cover, without which it might cease to be Viable. Across its range, the species inhabits several protected areas, and in Nepal, it has benefitted from conservation efforts targeted towards pheasants, including monitoring, education initiatives, and alternative livelihood projects. While the impact of such actions remains unevaluated, it is possible that national populations would be smaller if they had not taken place. The Conservation Legacy is therefore assessed as Medium. Cessation of current conservation efforts would have similarly negative impacts in the short-term future, indicating a Medium Conservation Dependence. Continuing these actions is expected to maintain the species' current status in Bhutan and Nepal, and a promising community project in India has the potential to stabilise the Indian population, representing a Medium Conservation Gain. Long-term, the implementation of Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs), improvements in protected area management, expansion of community-based programs, and mitigation of developmental impacts could significantly enhance the Species Recovery Score. However, uncertainty remains as to how much of the species' original habitat is intact or could be restored, leaving the Recovery Potential as Indeterminate.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Conservation efforts have only recently begun and are unlikely to have influenced the existing population, leading to a Conservation Legacy score of Zero. While newly initiated actions, such as awareness-raising and terrestrial vegetation restoration, could help prevent further declines, they are insufficient to restore the population within the next decade. Consequently, Conservation Gain is assessed as Zero, with the species expected to maintain its Current State over this period. Without conservation intervention, the population is likely to decline further, potentially reaching Critically Endangered status or, in the worst-case scenario, becoming extirpated. Ongoing threats, including habitat degradation from overgrazing and human population growth, could further reduce suitable habitat if no remedial measures are taken. Additionally, increasing poverty and lack of awareness could lead to renewed harvesting of crabs for food. Given these factors, Conservation Dependence is considered Low but significant. With targeted conservation efforts – such as restoring terrestrial habitats to maintain biodiversity, reducing localised grazing pressure, and protecting key sites (e.g. rocky surfaces, caves) from development – some subpopulations could achieve Functional status in localised areas. However, full recovery across the species' entire range may not be feasible. A realistic long-term goal would be achieving Least Concern status, reflecting a Medium Recovery Potential. However, climate change and predation by invasive species (e.g., rats, civet cats, and feral cats) introduce uncertainties.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

Research is ongoing to verify the population trend. The island is difficult to access, but some hunting may take place occasionally, so without legal protection of the island the species' would be expected to be worse off but still Present; therefore the Conservation Legacy and Conservation Dependence are both Medium. Looking to the future, there is some probability that a stochastic event (in this case, a fire) could drive the species to extinction within 20 years; therefore, all future scenarios include the possibility of extinction. In light of this, the Conservation Gain is Indeterminate. Because the population currently fluctuates around carrying capacity, it is unlikely that the species could increase to much higher levels, but in the long term, if there was evidence that the species was not declining and that all non-stochastic threats were not operating, the species may yet be considered Fully Recovered.

The PAN Faveiros project, which is dedicated to conserving this species and its threatened relatives, has led conservation interventions such as reintroductions, awareness-raising, research, and community engagement. The Recovery Score would be 3% lower today without these measures, as many of the remnant <em>D. wilsonii</em> populations would be smaller and at least two would be extirpated by now (a Low, but important, Conservation Legacy). If these measures were to stop, the Recovery Score would decrease by 7% over the next 10 years due to anthropogenic pressures (a Low Conservation Dependence). As this species has a long generation length, positive outcomes of conservation will take longer than 10 years to come to fruition (hence the Conservation Gain score of Zero). However, if current efforts continue, and reintroductions are extended to all suitable areas in the species' indigenous range, a Recovery Score of 31% could be attained within 100 years (a Medium Recovery Potential).<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

Despite its depleted state, the species has a High Conservation Legacy; prior to reintroductions, a remnant population of only 22 individuals remained, which would likely have been lost by now in the absence of captive breeding and reintroduction. Continued reintroductions, as well as medical intervention to treat lead poisoning, will help reintroduced populations to continue growing. However, because of the species' long lifespan, population growth will not be quick enough to attain Viable populations within 10 years; thus, the predicted Conservation Gain over this timeframe is Low. This said, if conservation measures were to stop now, the species would go into steep decline. As populations would most likely remain Present for the next 10 years, the Conservation Dependence is Zero; in this case, that signifies that the currently-small populations are not expected to go completely extinct without conservation in 10 years, but the species is unquestionably dependent on conservation to survive longer-term. In the next 100 years, it would be possible for Viable populations to be restored in four of the five spatial units, representing a Medium Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

Of the remaining four spatial units, it is Viable but non-Functional in one (Fore-Caucasus and West Caspian populations), Present but non-Viable in two (Mongolia and China population, Central and West Asia flyway populations), and extirpated in one (Central European population). In the BS-Med flyway spatial units, concerted conservation action has brought about major improvements in the state of the species. This is not the case in the other spatial units, were conservation action has been limited. Because of the spatial heterogeneity in conservation impact, the overall Conservation Legacy is Medium. The predicted Conservation Gain is Zero, because populations will most likely retain their current state for the next 10 years if ongoing measures continue. However, if all measures were to stop, the progress made in recent decades in the BS-Med flyway spatial units would be lost: the Conservation Dependence is Medium. If conservation actions implemented in the BS-Med flyway units were expanded to other areas, and reintroductions were performed in the extirpated Central European spatial unit, the Recovery Score could increase to 84%, representing a Medium Recovery Potential.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

      "justification": "The Blue Shark has a Species Recovery Score of 43% (Largely Depleted) due to its threatened or Near Threatened status in four of the six spatial units within its indigenous range. In the remaining two units, the species is Viable but not fulfilling its ecological functions at baseline levels. In some spatial units, specific conservation measures for Blue Sharks—such as catch limits and mandatory data reporting—are in place. In other units, while there are no targeted conservation measures for the species, broader shark protections exist, including reporting requirements, bans on shark lines and finning, and bycatch reduction measures. While these regulations have likely had a positive impact, Blue Shark bycatch remains high and continues to increase, leading to a Low Conservation Legacy assessment. If all current restrictions and regulations were removed, shark exploitation would likely rise across the species' range, further deteriorating its status. In the Mediterranean spatial unit, where overfishing is severe and the species is already in a critical state, the removal of protections could lead to local extirpation within a decade. As a result, the species is assessed as having Medium Conservation Dependence. If existing measures remain in place, the species is expected to maintain its overall status over the next decade, with some regions improving while others decline—resulting in a net Zero Conservation Gain. In the long term, with maximum conservation effort, the species' condition could improve significantly, reflecting a Medium Recovery Potential. Achieving this would require strict enforcement of catch limits and a temporary suspension of large-scale commercial fishing in the Mediterranean spatial unit.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a> document.",

      "justification": "Since the previous Green Status of Species assessment for the Saiga (Milner-Gulland 2021), the Saiga's Species Recovery Score has increased from 38% to 48%. Whilst it is still classified as Largely Depleted, it is now close to the threshold for Moderately Depleted due to conservation efforts improving the status of the species in two spatial units. However, it is still extirpated in some parts of its indigenous range, and threatened in parts of the remaining extant range. The Saiga has a High Conservation Legacy; without past conservation action, the Saiga would likely have gone extinct in one spatial unit, and would have lost viability and functionality in others, resulting in a score of 29%. Some of the positive effects of conservation have been masked somewhat by disease outbreaks, which have knocked the species back to levels lower than what had been achieved through concerted conservation, but population recovery has been observed since disease outbreaks, with one population recovering to a Functional state since the last Green Status of Species assessment. There is a High Conservation Dependence; if conservation actions like habitat protections and veterinary care were to stop, it is expected that the species' status would deteriorate in most spatial units over a 10-year period, and functionality is expected to be lost from all spatial units. The Saiga has a Medium Conservation Gain: within a 10-year period, if conservation continues, it is expected that two more spatial units will become Viable; combined with the planned reintroduction to a spatial unit where the species is currently Absent, a Green Score of 62% is expected to be achieved. Finally, within 100 years it would be possible for the Saiga to achieve a Green Score of 62%, the same as is anticipated for 10 years as some areas of the indigenous range are unlikely to provide suitable habitat even in the long term, and where there is suitable habitat it was deemed likely that the species could become Viable or Functional within 10 years. Due to there being uncertainty around whether some spatial units could support Viable or Functional populations in the long-term, largely due to human infrastructure, the Recovery Potential for the Saiga is indeterminate.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",

The African Penguin has a High Conservation Legacy; without protected areas, the African Penguin would possibly be extinct today. Conservation Dependence and Conservation Gain are both Zero: the species would likely not disappear from any spatial units within 10 years without conservation; with conservation, the species is not expected to become Viable in any spatial units within 10 years, given the species' slow reproduction. However, within 100 years it would be possible for the African Penguin to become Viable in three out of four spatial units, leading to a score of 58%. Therefore, the Recovery Potential for the African Penguin is Medium.<br/><br/>For additional data, see the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/gss-supplementary\">Supplementary Information</a>&#160;document.",
